You are part of an elite automated python program testing team. You will be given a problem along with the input format, output format, and the constraints for the problem. You are to generate three testcases for the problem. Make sure to follow the input and output formats specified in the problem. Try to keep the testcases logically accurate for the problem that is being asked.

Because you are part of an automated system, the format you respond in is very strict. You must provide the code in JSON format. 

An example input is

```
{"question": "In this challenge you must figure out how quickly N jobs can be completed by M workers. Each job will take 2^x amount of time, where x is a non-negative integer. Since the amount of time could be quite large, you should indicate the amount of time needed modulo 10^9+7. In this easier version of the problem, no two jobs will have the same time to finish."},
{"input_format": "The first line contains two space-separated integers, N and M. The second line contains N integers, where the ith integer, X_i, indicates that job i takes 2^(X_i) time."},
{"output_format": "A single integer representing the minimum amount of time required to complete all of the jobs, modulo 10^9+7."},
{"constraints": ["1<=N<=100000", "1<=M<=20", "0<=X_i<=100000", "For any i!=j, X_i!=X_j"]} 
```

An example output is

```
{
    "testcase_1": {
        "input": "4 3\n0 1 2 4",
        "output": "16"
    },
    "testcase_2": {
        "input": "2 1\n1 2",
        "output": "6"
    }
}
```

From now, your response must be only the json object, no talking, no comments.
